        <section class="bio" data-testid="test-about-bio">
          <h3>Short Bio</h3>
          <p>
            I’m someone who believes that growth happens when curiosity meets
            consistency. My journey into tech started with nothing but a laptop,
            a bootcamp, a few tutorials, and an unshakable desire to create
            something meaningful. I remember the first time I built a small
            webpage, although it wasn’t perfect, but it sparked something in me.
            Since then, I’ve been on an adventure of learning, unlearning, and
            building. Now, as a frontend developer, I enjoy turning ideas into
            interactive, user-friendly experiences. I love the feeling of
            bringing design to life, solving tricky problems, and watching my
            skills evolve with every new challenge. Beyond code, I’m driven by
            connection, by the stories, collaborations, and shared passion that
            make tech such a vibrant space to grow in.

          <h3>My Goals in This Program</h3>
          <p>
            My goal in the HNG program is to go beyond just learning, I want to
            grow through experience and build meaningful connections with people
            who share the same hunger for improvement. I see this program as a
            bridge between what I’ve already learnt and the professional
            developer I aspire to become. I want to work on real projects that
            push me outside my comfort zone, collaborate with talented
            teammates, and learn how to navigate challenges in a team
            environment. I believe growth happens in community, through
            feedback, collaboration, and shared problem-solving. So while I aim
            to sharpen my technical skills, I also want to form bonds with
            people who inspire me, challenge me, and maybe even walk alongside
            me long after HNG ends.

          <h3>Areas of Growth</h3>
          <p>
            If I’m being honest, I sometimes struggle with confidence when I’m
            stepping into something unfamiliar, like a new technology or a
            complex project that feels bigger than what I’ve handled before.
            There are moments I question if I’m good enough or if I belong in
            certain spaces where everyone seems to know more. But over time,
            I’ve learned that it’s okay to feel uncertain. Confidence, for me,
            is no longer about having all the answers, it’s about staying
            curious enough to find them. I’m learning to give myself grace, to
            ask questions without fear, and to see mistakes as proof that I’m
            trying. I may not always feel confident, but I’m always willing to
            grow and that, I’ve realized, is a quiet kind of courage.

          <h3>Note To My Future Self</h3>
          <p>
            Hey future me, I hope you’re smiling right now, not because
            everything is perfect, but because you remember where it all
            started. You remember the nights you sat staring at error messages
            that made no sense. You remember doubting whether you were even cut
            out for this tech journey. You remember that feeling of staring at a
            blank VS Code window, unsure how to begin, but you began anyway.
            Back then, every little win mattered. The first “Hello World.” The
            first time your CSS grid finally aligned. The first project that
            actually worked the way you imagined it would. You didn’t know it
            then, but every late night debugging session, every YouTube tutorial
            you replayed a hundred times, every small improvement, they were
            shaping you into the developer you are today. So if life ever gets
            busy and you start to forget the “why,” pause and breathe. Remember
            that your journey wasn’t just about becoming a great developer, it
            was about becoming a person who never gave up on growth. You once
            prayed to be where you are now. You once dreamed of building things
            that make people’s lives easier. So don’t lose that fire, that
            curiosity, that hunger to learn. Celebrate the progress, no matter
            how small. Stay humble, stay kind, and keep showing up, even on the
            hard days. Because one day, you’ll look back again… and smile even
            wider.
          </p>

        <section class="extra-thoughts" data-testid="test-about-extra">
          <h3>Extra Thoughts</h3>
          <p>
            If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that progress rarely feels
            like progress when you’re in the middle of it. It’s easy to look
            around and feel behind, but growth is often invisible until one day
            you look back and realize how far you’ve come. I joined this journey
            not just to build skills, but to build resilience, to learn how to
            keep showing up even when things get hard. I’m excited, nervous, and
            hopeful all at once. And if I could leave a note to myself for this
            program, it would simply say: Be open. Be kind. Learn loudly. Fail
            gracefully. Keep building. Because every experience, whether it’s a
            success or a struggle, is another line of code in the story I’m
            writing for myself.
